# lookingBack
​
A way to memorialize your loved ones. Created for the purpose of preserving your lasting memories with those that have passed on. lookingBack gives users a way to create Tribute pages for those that are no longer with us. It gives family members and friends a way to reminisce about the memories created over a life time. Now all family members will have access to photo albums, stories, comments, and anything else to remember those that mean the most to us.
